        Words & Strings started with a group of 5 enthusiastic and
        multi-talented youth, who are passionate about arts, and specifically
        spoken word.This group attempted to fill the gap between the existence
        of talent and the lack of consistent platform to share it, with the aim
        to create an open space for artists and art lovers to come together and
        comfortably share their talents on the only consistent, platform for
        spoken word art in Qatar.
      </p>
      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
